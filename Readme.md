# HOF and Functional Programming Project

## Overview
This project showcases the application of Higher Order Functions (HOF) and Functional Programming concepts in JavaScript. The project includes six JavaScript files, each demonstrating different functionalities:

1. **Reverse String after Delay**
2. **Random Number Generator with Delay and Progress Indication**
3. **Building a Feature for Store's Inventory**
4. **Filtering and Capitalizing: Books Published After 2010 with Author Names**
5. **URL Validation**
6. **LinkedIn Profile URL Validator**

## Project Files

### 1. Reverse String after Delay
- This file contains code to reverse a given string after a specified delay using Higher Order Functions.

### 2. Random Number Generator with Delay and Progress Indication
- This file generates random numbers after a delay, showing progress indication during the process. It utilizes Higher Order Functions to achieve the functionality.

### 3. Build a Feature for Store's Inventory
- Here, a feature for managing a store's inventory is implemented using functional programming principles. It might include functions for adding items, removing items, updating quantities, etc.

### 4. Filtering and Capitalizing: Books Published After 2010 with Author Names
- This file demonstrates filtering a list of books published after 2010 and capitalizing author names. It exemplifies the usage of Higher Order Functions for filtering and mapping operations.

### 5. URL Validation
- The code in this file validates URLs using regular expressions. It showcases how Higher Order Functions can be used to perform validation tasks.

### 6. LinkedIn Profile URL Validator
- This script focuses on validating LinkedIn profile URLs. It's an application of Higher Order Functions combined with regular expressions for specific URL validation.

## Usage
- Each JavaScript file can be run independently to see its functionality.
- Make sure to have Node.js installed to execute the scripts.

## Contributing
- Contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.
